## Web Scraping AmbitionBox Data & PowerBi Dashboard 
A Python script for web scraping company data from AmbitionBox, a popular platform for company reviews and insights in India.

## Introduction
AmbitionBox is a valuable resource for job seekers and professionals, offering extensive information about companies, including employee reviews, salaries, and interview experiences. Manually collecting this data for analytical purposes is impractical due to the sheer volume. This project addresses this challenge by automating the data extraction process through web scraping.

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to systematically collect comprehensive company data from the AmbitionBox website, specifically focusing on the "list of companies" page. This involves:

* Automating data retrieval: Developing a script to programmatically fetch web page content.
* Overcoming anti-scraping measures: Implementing strategies to handle common website defenses, such as 403 Forbidden errors.
* Parsing and extracting data: Accurately extracting structured information from the raw HTML.
* Data preparation: Laying the groundwork for storing and potentially analyzing the extracted data.

## Power BI Dashboard

A Power BI Dashboard has been created to provide an interactive and insightful view of the scraped AmbitionBox dataset. This dashboard allows users to:
* Explore Company Metrics: Visualize overall review trends, and other aggregated data.
* Filter and Segment:Dynamically filter data by various parameters such as industry, location, company size, or specific rating ranges.
* Identify Key Trends: Gain insights into industry performance, popular companies, and areas of improvement based on employee feedback.
* Interactive Visualizations: Utilize various charts, graphs, and tables to present the data effectively.
